# BrainSim: Neural Activity Simulation and Prediction

BrainSim is a research project focused on modeling and predicting neural spike activity patterns in brain imaging data. The project implements various deep learning models to generate and predict sequential neural activity patterns.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
1. Process neural spike data from multiple subjects
2. Create autoencoder models to compress and reconstruct neural activity patterns
3. Implement a Generative Brain Model (GBM) that can predict future neural activity states
4. Provide visualization tools for analyzing model performance

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BrainSim.git
   cd BrainSim
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tqdm h5py opencv-python
   pip install mamba-ssm  # For state space models
   ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation
The project expects processed spike data in HDF5 format. Each file should contain:
- `spikes`: Binary spike events
- `cell_positions`: 3D coordinates of cells
- `timepoints`: Timestamps for each frame

### Training a Simple Autoencoder
```bash
python -m GenerativeBrainModel.scripts.train_simple_autoencoder
```

This trains an autoencoder to compress and reconstruct neural activity patterns. The model will be saved in the `experiments/autoencoder/` directory.

### Training the Generative Brain Model
```bash
python -m GenerativeBrainModel.scripts.train_gbm
```

This trains a GBM to predict future neural activity states based on past observations. The model and visualizations will be saved in the `experiments/gbm/` directory.

## Visualization

The training scripts automatically generate:
- Loss plots showing training and validation performance
- Videos comparing actual neural activity with model predictions
- Data check videos to verify dataset generation

Videos are saved in the `experiments/*/videos/` directories and can be viewed with any standard video player.

## Model Architecture

### Simple Autoencoder
- Encoder: Linear layer mapping from input size (32768) to hidden size (1024)
- Decoder: Linear layer mapping from hidden size back to input size
- Activation: Sigmoid function for binary output

### Generative Brain Model (GBM)
- Pretrained autoencoder for encoding/decoding neural activity patterns
- Mamba-based sequential predictor for modeling temporal dynamics
- Binary Cross Entropy loss function for training

## Performance Considerations

- The dataset generation process pads sequences to ensure uniform length
- Video generation is limited to a maximum number of frames to prevent excessive file sizes
- Training parameters can be adjusted in the respective script files
