# Generative Brain Model: Neural Activity Simulation and Prediction

This is a research project focused on modeling and predicting neural spike activity patterns in brain imaging data. 

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
1. Process neural spike data from multiple subjects
2. Create autoencoder models to compress and reconstruct neural activity patterns
3. Implement a Generative Brain Model (GBM) that can predict future neural activity states
4. Provide visualization tools for analyzing model performance
